        Releasenotes for IdentitySwitcher</h1>
    <h2>
        Version 03.00.00</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated to build on DNN 7.4.1.280.  Upgraded all the Obsolete API calls.  This allows it to run on DNN 9.</li>
        <li>Updated to use NuGet to obtain the DNN dependency</li>
        <li>Updated automated packaging through MSBuild Tasks.  It used to fail unless MSBuild Community Tasks were installed to a fiarly precise location.  The import allows a fallback location.  The build now works based on the fallback location.</li>
    </ul>
